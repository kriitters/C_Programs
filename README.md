# C_Programs
Temporary documentation of C code for spatcon.c and grayspatcon.c.  

## Contents
spatcon and grayspatcon have been deployed in Peter Vogt's GTB and GWB apps.  
Eventually, to support re-deployment via R scripts in CyVerse apps, this repo will have better documentation.  
Meanwhile, please see Peter's repo https://github.com/ec-jrc/GWB/tree/main/tools/external_sources.  
That repo contains:
- source code for spatcon.c and grayspatcon.c
- compiled, static-linked executables for spatcon.c and grayspatcon.c
- user Guides (pdf) for spatcon.c and grayspatcon.c
- links to further information about Peter's GTB and GWB
